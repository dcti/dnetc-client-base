          </ul>
          <a name="started"></a><h2>Getting started</h2>
		  <p> Just unpack the client in a directory of your choice and fire it 
            up.</p>

          <p> If you have never run the client before, it will initiate the menu-driven 
            configuration. Save and quit when done, the configuration file will 
            be saved in the same directory as the client. Then, simply restart 
            the client. From that point on it will use the saved configuration.</p>
          <p>The configuration options are fairly self-explanatory and can be run
    at any time by starting the client with the '-config' option.
    A list of command line options is available by starting the client 
    with '-help'.</p>
	      <p>A detailed guide to the various configuration options is available 
            online at <a href="http://www.distributed.net/FAQ/">http://www.distributed.net/FAQ/</a></p>
          <a name="service" class="h3replace"></a><h3>Running the client as a Win9x/WinNT Service</h3>
		  <p>A Win9x/WinNT service is a process that starts running when the 
    computer is powered up, and does not stop until the computer is powered
    down. Unlike normal processes, services will continue to run even when
    a user logs out.</p>

	<p>Obviously, a service does not have access to remote file and disk 
    resources that require a user to log in first. (this restriction
    can be nullified on NT - see FAQ below)</p>
	<p> To install the client as a service, run the client with the -install
    switch. This will cause it to register itself with the service handler,
    which will in turn automatically start the client the next time the
    computer is powered up. To deinstall a client previously installed as
    a service, start it with the -uninstall switch.
</p>
		  <a name="multiplexor" class="h3replace"><h3>The screensaver multiplexor</h3></a>
		  <p>Beginning with v2.7112.444, the client release archive includes a
    screensaver multiplexor.</p>

	<p>Note that the screen saver and the client are different executables.
    The screen saver multiplexor (*.scr) is of little use without a 
    client (*.exe).</p>
	<p>Under normal circumstances, having a client running continuously in
    the background is usually preferred since it continues to use
    the idle processor cycles even when a machine is actively in use. 
    For instance, when typing a letter, the machine is really mostly
    idle, waiting for keystrokes, and the client can use that time.</p>
	<p>  However, in some environments, utilizing *any* cpu time while a 
    user is actively trying to use the machine may be a problem. The 
    distributed.net screen saver multiplexor addresses that issue. 
    When activated by the system, it will launch a client in the 
    background and _another_ screen saver of your choice in the 
    foreground. If a client is already found to be running when the
    screen saver is activated by the system, it will not be started
    a second time.</p>
	      <p>Not only does this permit an installation where use of any cpu time 
            is a problem, it also resolves two other issues that a client-as-a-screensaver 
            cannot: a) it does not requires storage of client buffers and/or configuration 
            file in the windows (or windows/system) directory and b) it allows 
            a user to continue to use his/her preferred screensaver.</p>
			
			Installation involves...
          <ol>             
            <li>simply copying the *.scr file included with the client distribution 
              to one of the following locations: on Win9x: your \WINDOWS\ or \WINDOWS\SYSTEM\ 
              directory on WinNT: your \WINNT\ or \WINNT\SYSTEM32\ directory</li>

            <li>Once you have copied it, go to the Display properties in the Control 
              Panel and select the distributed.net screen saver as the active 
              screen saver.</li>
            <li>Clicking on the &quot;Settings...&quot; button opens the multiplexors 
              configuration dialog. Select the client you wish the multiplexor 
              to run in the background and select the screensaver you wish to run
              in the foreground</li>
            <li>If the client had been previously configured, there is nothing 
              else you need do. Otherwise click on the &quot;Configure&quot; button 
              to configure the client.</li>
          </ol>

	<p>Note for Windows NT 3.x: The screensaver API changed between NT 3.x
    and NT 4.x to support the "mini-preview" mode first introduced in
    Windows95. The multiplexor supports the new interface, but since a 4.x 
    system will not start a 3.x screensaver "correctly", the multiplexor
    was "branded" as a 4.0 executable.</p>
	<p>Beginning with 2.8001, the _client_ will watch for this condition on
    startup, and if it finds itself in a 3.x environment, will re-brand 
    the .scr as a 3.x executable.</p>

	<a name="notes"></a><h2>Notes</h2>
	<p>Beginning with v2.8001.445, the client distribution includes a separate
    CUI wrapper that communicates with the GUI client over pipes. Older
    clients can be started in native CUI mode either by renaming the .exe to
    .com, or by using a patch utility to change the executable's subsystem 
    type to CUI.</p>
      <p>Beginning with v2.2702.419, the win32 CLI client consolidates the rc5des.exe 
            (normal CUI client), rc5desh.exe (hidden client) and rc5dessvc.exe 
            (service mode client) in one executable. It no longer runs as a native 
            console session (CUI), but emulates a "console" in a GUI window.</p>
          <ol>

            <li>the client can be started "hidden";</li>
            <li>conagent is not loaded which cuts down the overhead; </li>
            <li>the client is more efficient;</li>
            <li>the client is not susceptible to misconfigured "DOS" settings</li>
            <li>the client can be shutdown with "close" and will shutdown the 
              client can be shutdown with "close" and will shutdown</li>
            <li>it gets rid of the "DOS box" and persistant icon on taskbar;</li>

            <li>the client can be minimized to the systray;</li>
            <li>most importantly, the client uses exactly the same source code 
              base as all the other clients on all the other platforms. This enhances 
              the client's stability since the chances that a bug will remain 
              undetected for long are greatly reduced.</li>
            <li>The client is capable of asyncronously executing client
        "modes", ie -fetch, -flush, -update and so on. Clicking with 
        right mouse button on the client window will bring up a "mode" menu.</li>
          </ol>
		  <p>Beginning with v2.2706.425, it is no longer mandatory to have 
    winsock.dll/wsock32.dll installed.</p>
	<a name="faq"></a><h2>FAQ</h2>

          
          <p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the changes in this version of the client?<br>
            <strong>A:</strong> They are listed in the file CHANGES.txt, included 
            with this client distribution.</p>
          <p> <strong>Q:</strong> Where is the (what-used-to-be-) GUI version 
            of the client?<br>

            <strong>A:</strong> The &quot;GUI&quot; features not in the non-&quot;GUI&quot; 
            client, are/will be release as portable, separate utilities. The code 
            will be &quot;Open Source&quot;. As always, user contribution will 
            be much appreciated. See <a href="http://www.distributed.net/download/addon.php">http://www.distributed.net/download/addon.php</a></p>

          <p> <strong>Q:</strong> Is it possible to start the client as a service 
            and yet keep it visible on the desktop or taskbar?<br>

            <strong>A:</strong> Services are not supposed to be interactive. Services 
            are a hair above device drivers, and on NT many 'devices' are indeed 
            implemented as services (RAS for instance). There is a special category 
            of interactive services, but they are rare (like kernel debuggers), 
            and NT only. Some 'interactive' functionality may be achieved by enabling 
            logging to file and by using the client's command line -shutdown, 
            -restart, -pause and -unpause options. An attempt to force a client 
            installed as an NT service to &quot;interact with [the] desktop&quot; 
            will not work as expected.</p>
          <p> <strong>Q:</strong> How do I check that the client is in fact running 
            hidden/as a service? <br>
            <strong>A:</strong> On NT, service status can be determined in the 
            service manager and the task manager will show the client taking up 
            lots of cpu time. Win9x does not have a service manager or a task 
            manager, so you will need to either enable logging or use 'wintop' 
            or similar utility. (wintop for Windows 9x is available from the 'kerneltoys' 
            pack or at <a href="http://www.distributed.net/download/addon.php">http://www.distributed.net/download/addon.php</a>)</p> 
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the client's service keys/ID?<br> <strong>A:</strong> If you 
            use NT, it will be in the service manager. The client's service ID 
            (shortname) is &quot;dnetc&quot; for v2.80xx and later, and &quot;rc5desnt&quot; 
            or &quot;bovrc5nt&quot; for pre-2.80xx clients. On Win9x (Win9x doesn't 
            have a service manager), the client is registered with the registry 
            as &quot;distributed.net client&quot; (or &quot;bovwin32&quot; in 
            very old versions) under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE in \Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunService</p>

          <p> <strong>Q:</strong> How do I stop the service from the command line? <br>
            <strong>A:</strong> Run the client with '-shutdown' or, on NT, 'net 
            stop SERVICEID' (see previous question for service ID)</p>
          <p> <strong>Q:</strong> When installed as a service, the client cannot 
            access files on remote drives (network shares). How come? <br>

			<strong>A:</strong> 
            When installed as a service, the client is (on NT, by default) not 
            running in a user's context (there isn't a user logged in). Under 
            Win9x, where security is virtually non-existant, the client *could* 
            theoretically access network shares /once/ a user has logged in, but 
            that is obviously not a good idea :). On NT, the service can be configured 
            from the service manager to start in a context other than the default 
            &quot;Local System&quot;: Control Panel -&gt; services -&gt; properties 
            on service. there's a radio button to change between local system 
            and another account.<br> Thor Olson &lt;<a href="mailto:Thor@terabase.com">Thor@terabase.com</a>&gt; 
            adds: <br>If the machine is a backup domain controller, all control panel 
            choices for service userids/passwords, other than localuser, are grayed 
            out whenever the machine doesn't have a connection to the primary 
            domain controller.</p>

          <p> <strong>Q:</strong> On NT, trying to -install as service from 'AT' fails, but
            works fine otherwise. Whats up with that?<br>
            <strong>A:</strong> AT runs by default in a non-desktop context, and 
            the client's &quot;have a valid shell&quot; check fails. The solution 
            is to check 'interact with desktop' in the scheduler config and install 
            the service with &quot;-quiet -install&quot;.</p>
          <p> <strong>Q:</strong> I run the client from the Startup menu of Windows (it fires up 
            alone every time I log into Windows). I want it to be minimized when 
            it starts... How do I do that?<br>

            <strong>A:</strong> The way you would for any application: 
          <ol>
            <li>highlight the name in the menu</li>
            <li>right-click. A menu will pop up menu.</li>
            <li>select &quot;Properties&quot; (last option on the menu that 
            appears)</li>

            <li>change to the &quot;Shortcut&quot; tab in the &quot;Properties&quot; 
            dialog</li>
            <li>in the &quot;Run:&quot; dropdown menu (second from the bottom), 
            change &quot;Normal Window&quot; to &quot;Minimized&quot;

            -&gt; click &quot;OK&quot;</li>
            </ol>
            
          <p><strong>Q:</strong> I use LITESTEP (or other alternative shell) and 
            get a warning when I try to install the client as a service. Whats 
            the deal?<br>
            <strong>A:</strong> A user suggested: &quot;I don't know about other 
            shells, but LITESTEP (as of 0.24.4) appears to not completely adhere 
            to the Microsoft specifications of what tasks a shell should fulfill. 
            Installing the LiteMAN module fixes whatever it is in Litestep thats 
            broken. Here's the link: <a href="http://www.litestep.org/binaries/liteman-b3.zip">http://www.litestep.org/binaries/liteman-b3.zip</a></p>

          <p> <strong>Q:</strong> I want to run the client and XYZ simultaneously, 
            but XYZ destroys my crunch rate. What can I do?<br>
		 <strong>A: </strong>Uninstall XYZ :)</p>
            
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> I want to run the client as a screen saver. How do I do this?<br>
            <strong>A:</strong> Beginning with v2.7112.444, the client release archive includes 
            a screensaver multiplexor. When activated, it will launch a client 
            in the background and _another_ screen saver of your choice in the 
            foreground. Documentation is elsewhere in this file.</p>

            
            
          <p><strong>Q:</strong> I want to run the client at a higher priority 
            than zero/idle. This functionality was removed in some past version, 
            but I *really*, *really* need it or my other XXX program will simply 
            hog the CPU. What can I do?<br>
			 <strong>A:</strong> It never went away. 
            Only the help text said it did. :) Hovever, be *very* careful. Windows' 
            thread scheduling/priority assignment is brain dead beyond belief. 
            Read the text in the config screen before you fiddle with the priority 
            setting!</p>

          <p> <strong>Q:</strong> My client's window shows characters in a weird 
            font. Is the client trying to access a font not on my system? <strong>A:</strong> 
            No. The client never loads fonts by name. It loads by type/family, 
            that is, only fonts of fixed-pitch (every 'character' has the same 
            width). The advantage is of course that the client need not know what 
            fonts are installed. The disadvantage is that if there is _no_ font 
            at all that fits the bill, GDI uses the first font that matches the 
            other specified attributes, ie font height/width etc. As a rule, the 
            client's display will be fine as long as at least the standard Windows 
            fonts are available. [nb: there is a Word Perfect linedraw font that 
            mis-identified itself as typographic. Delete it!]</p>

            
            
          <p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the 'Dialup interfaces' option I see 
            in the config?<br> 
			<strong>A:</strong> Dial-up detection was previously 
            available only the RAS (Remote Access Service) API. Beginning with 
            2.7110.440, the Win32 client is capable of detecting 'UP' state on 
            *non-RAS* devices such as ISDN adapters that are not RAS capable or 
            AOL's proprietary modem adapter which appears as a network cards and 
            not as a modems. The 'Dialup interfaces' list then allows you to mask 
            or mask-out those devices you do not want the client to 'see'. Windows 
            has no consistant naming scheme for network adapters: What appears 
            as &quot;PPP Adapter NdisWan'n'&quot; on NT, appears as &quot;'i' 
            Ethernet Adapter&quot; on Windows9x and the numbering sequence ('n' 
            and 'i') isn't uniform either. To simplify this, the client refers 
            to all dialup adapters as &quot;ppp[0-9]&quot; and all non-dialup 
            devices as &quot;eth[0-9]&quot;. Generally speaking, if you were happy 
            with the way lurk worked before, you probably do need the 'Dialup 
            interfaces' option now.</p>

          <p> *NOTE*: If you are running WinGate (NAT) proxy on the same machine
            that the client is on, and wish the client to go online only if
            a connection is already open, then you CANNOT use RAS - you must
            tell the client to use the 'Dialup Interfaces' (specify 'ppp*').</p>
          <p> <strong>Q:</strong> Can I share my win32 client's buffers with non-win32 clients?
            [&quot;sharing&quot; is simultaneous access via file-sharing, but 
            also manual transfer of the buffer files from one machine to another]<br>
            <strong>A: </strong>Yes. It is however a good idea to ensure that 
            clients sharing buffers all have the same version number. For instance, 
            if your share buffers between 2.7110.440 and other older clients, 
            you must ensure that the client newer than 2.7109 do not request &quot;big-block&quot;s 
            from the keyservers (ensure 'preferred-packet-size' is less than 32). 
            Read the general FAQ for specifics. SAMBA note: Samba supports &quot;opportunistic 
            locking&quot;, which implies that the Samba client's view of the remote 
            volume is cached. This option is on by default. Consequently, if you 
            are accessing data on a samba mount both via Samba and via the native-FS, 
            you *must* &quot;veto oplock &lt;paths&gt;&quot; in your Samba configuration.</p>

          <p> <strong>Q:</strong> I have troble minimizing the client. It sits 
            on the taskbar for several seconds before finally moving to the tray.

            I think I found the problem. Norton Systemworks 2001 by default, runs 
            a tray icon manager for their software(Norton System Doctor, &gt; 
            Norton Anti-Virus, etc etc). I turned off the tray icon manager and 
            rebooted, and the client then minimizes to the systray with no lag.</p>

          <p> <strong>Q:</strong> I have trouble using the client in conjunction 
            with MS-proxy, and keep getting HTTP error: '407 Proxy authentication 
            required' <br>
            <strong>A:</strong> From: Alexei Anatski (<a href="mailto:chatskiy@email.com">chatskiy@email.com</a>)<br>
            The problem is that MS Proxy is usually configured to requre NTLM 
            (NT Domain) authentication. So far only IE is capable of this. Solution 
            is to install &quot;Winsock-proxy&quot; client from MS Proxy Setup. 
            It works at socket level so any application can use it transparently. 
            You may need assistance from your system administrator. </p>

          <p> <strong>Q:</strong> How do I completely remove the this client from 
            my system?<br>
            <strong>A:</strong> First run the client with the '-uninstall' switch 
            to ensure that it is not installed as a service. Then, simply delete 
            all files in the client's directory.</p>
