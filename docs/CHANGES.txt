  | | |   |   |  bugzilla format build time stamp (time of newest module)
  | | |   |   |  Please report this when making bug reports.
  | | |   |   `- Build flags: GUI/CLI, SMP-aware, etc.
  | | |   |      Please report this when making bug reports.
  | | |   `----- Changes in /common/ code, or simply a significant number
  | | |          of bug fixes, gets a "build fraction" change.
  | | `--------- New cores, for any platform, will be accompanied by a
  | |            "build version" change, ie 2.7103.x to 2.7104.x+1.
  | |            New significant feature(s) also increment build version.
  | `----------- A "client contest" change follows a code freeze at which
  |              point the client is assumed to be stable. Code that
  |              would make clients incompatible with previous clients or
  |              proxies will be a accompanied by 'client contest' change.
  `------------- Denotes a client rewrite.

                 and then splits it locally into sub-packets. Greatly
                 improves network throughput and reduces server load.

                 "update on per-project buffer exhaustion" which enables
                 old-style single-contest crunching (disables rotation).

                 the use of big packets enabled and clients older than
                 2.7109.440 since older clients will truncate the packets.
