            fix: all: current packet wasn't discarded on contest closure.
            fix: all: exited without crunching with "-n 1" option.
            new: *ix: all clients for unix are inherently SMP capable, 
                      even the OS does not have/support threads.

2.8013.467  new: 68k: new, faster RC5 cores (previously only available in

            new: ia64: new 4 pipeline ansi core, used by ia64.
            imp: all: add support for a second argument to -test/-bench, the
                 number to use.  example: 'dnetc -test rc5 8' 
            imp: some: OGR behaves more predictably on non-preemptive systems.

            imp: win32 cui: tweaked for considerably improved display speed.
            fix: win32 cui: redirection to file works as it did prior to .465.
            chg: all: the list of available cores is a superset of all cores
                 available for a particular architecture, some of which may
                 not be available for a particular client/OS/hardware flavour.
            fix: riscos: time and timezone oddities.
            fix: win32: workaround for time bug on some win2k HALs.

            new: all: command line options may be passed via a 'dnetc_opt=' 
                 (or 'DNETC_OPT=') environment variable.
            new: *nix: command line options may be overridden by a command
                 file in [/usr/local]/etc/. Refer to the man page for details.
            new: *nix: optional -multiok=0 switch to prohibit multiple 
                 instances of the client from running at the same time.
            new: linux: now supports -[un]install for SYSV-style rc.d
            chg: rc5: random-prefix is no longer written to the .ini
            chg: all: If a dialup connection had been previously initiated 
                 by the client AND the link drops while doing network i/o,
                 the client will dial again.
            new: the crunch-o-meter displays a twirling baton (by default) if
                 not running with a GUI window and output is not redirected.
            imp: networking layer rewritten from scratch. It is also a lot
                 more chatty, and prints very specific messages on error.
            new: client can be configured with multiple keyserver names.
            fix: all: no more uneccesary connects when using frequent-checks

            chg: all: the default keserver port (when port number is zero) 
                 for HTTP encoding is 80. The default HTTP proxy port is 8080.
            fix: all: for 'rotate' log file types: if the interval (limit)
                 is specified in days then the date in the filename reflects
                 the date of the first day of that interval.
            new: all: by default displays a different crunch-o-meter when an
                 OGR packet is being worked on. (any sug. for improvement?)
            chg: minor adjustments to Loaded/Saved/Completed/Summary messages
                 for project independance (format doesn't have to be processed
                 differently for different projects). Inexact percentages 
                 (ie, for OGR) are no longer displayed at load/save time.
            new: win16/32: crunch-o-scope, menus et al. (christmas present :)
            new: AmigaOS: fifo log file type now enabled

                 portability issues by building against static libc5
                 client runs on all elf kernels, 2.0.x - 2.4.x-preX
            imp: all: client always fetches the largest packet possible
                 and then splits it locally into sub-packets. Greatly
                 improves network throughput and reduces server load.
            fix: win32: .462 client was taking long to shutdown.
            chg: AmigaOS: 68060 core is now used on 040s too (it's faster)

                 mainly only affected overclocked CPUs

2.8010.462  fix: many: removed os-level file locking introduced in .459,
                 didn't work reliably on some file systems, and was not
                 really necessary anyway.
            chg: some: smoother ^C and break handling for win16/dos/amigaos

2.8010.461  new: x86: RC5/K7 core from Holger Boehring <HBoehring@hboehring.de>
            fix: x86: Athlon Thunderbird correctly detected now.

            new: macosx: full LURK support under MacOSX
            chg: macos: GUSI is in again but this time with OT support
            new: x86-NetBSD/x86-FreeBSD/Linux support battery-power checking

            chg: AmigaOS: now using the PowerPC OGR core
            chg: AmigaOS: lots more general changes and fixes

2.8009.460  new: ppc: new OGR PowerPC core by nate is about 12% faster
            chg: 68k: modified glue code results in up to 4% more speed

            chg: macos: priority adjustment works fine now
            new: macos: the client is now controlable through AppleScript
            new: macos: FBA/daemon version
            chg: macos: process detection for "pause-if-running" now works
            new: "pause-if-CPU-temperature-exceeds" (not on all platforms)
            new: "pause-if-running-on-batterypower" (not on all platforms)
            new: macosx: a native (BSD subsystem) client for Server and DPs
            chg: some: OGR is auto-disabled for non-preemptive OSs running on 
                 low-end cpus. http://www.distributed.net/faq/cache/188.html
            fix: NetWare: all MP (migration) issues resolved.     
            fix: most: user changes to time-of-day won't affect "Summary:"
            chg: AmigaOS: updated 68k cores and many changes made to bring
                 the Amiga version up to date
            chg: AmigaOS: switched from the sas/c compiler to gcc
            new: AmigaOS: native WarpUp/WarpOS client for PowerPC
            new: ppc: additional rc5 core optimized specifically for 604

2.8008.459  new: x86: new rc5 K7 core thanks to
                 Sean Stanek <vulture@iastate.edu>
            new: all: the "update frequently (-frequent)" has been superceded
                 by "additional buffer-level checking". The new option
                 provides better control and supports one new mode
                 "update on per-project buffer exhaustion" which enables
                 old-style single-contest crunching (disables rotation).
                 See also: http://www.distributed.net/faq/cache/176.html
            new: all: out-buffer thresholds have been removed entirely;
                 use the "additional buffer-level checking" to support
                 updating/flushing more frequently than buffer exhaustion.
            chg: all: time threshold uses fetch work threshold > 0 as minimum
                 number of workunits to be fetched.
            new: all: -btime <pn> <n> complements time-driven threshold
            chg: all: -b[in] <pn> <n> now clears time threshold for <pn>.
            new: all: exit flagfile filename is now configurable.
            chg: macos: now supports all variants of System 7
            fix: Linux: dynamic import of dns resolution functions for better
                 glibc/libc cross compatibility (one shoe fits all again).
            fix: winnt: pause on process handling optimized and rewritten.
            chg: all: checkpointing now done at 10% or 10 minute intervals,
                 instead of 10% with 10 minute minimum.
            fix: all: project switchover no longer 'hangs'.
            fix: all: OGR nodecount network packet ordering fixed.
            fix: all: reported OGR noderate is no longer unacceptably high.
            fix: all: partially complete OGR stubs are now loaded first. 
            fix: all: will now flush to a proxy/server that is empty.
            fix: all: setting clock back during network ops could hang.
            fix: all: block counts during fetching do not fluctuate anymore.
            fix: FreeBsd: timezone use for automatic keyserver pick works.
            chg: many: file system locking on buffers where supported.

2.8007.458  fix: all: the annoying OGR 1 node bug finally fixed
            new: all: client can be configured a) to restart itself
                 on .ini change; b) (on most platforms) to pause itself as
                 long as process/executable x|y|z|... is running.
            fix: win32: use NULL DACLs for CreateMutex.
            chg: macos: numerous minor interface improvements
            new: macos: multiprocessor support (MP 2.x enhanced)

2.8006.457  fix: BeOS: work not being saved on exit
            fix: *nix: -config hangs client

2.8005.453  chg: client supports thresholds either as a time-factor, or
                 as a workunit-factor. -config documentation has more info.
                 A review of your settings is *strongly* advised.

2.8004.452  chg: all: .ini option spin off from the generic [parameters]
                 section into subsections is now complete. phew! Nothing
                 left except "id".
            chg: reverted log file opening on win/dos/netware/os2 to
                 non-shared.

2.8004.451  fix: OS/2: Fixed crash in -config by using different API calls
            fix: OS/2: included the forgotten CSC-MMX core.
            fix: win32 Alpha: network connect()
            fix: all: 2 digit date in log-by-mail
            fix: solaris x86: multithreading works correctly now (uses
                 native threads bound to LWPs instead of pthreads)
            chg: log file is opened shared on win/dos/netware/os2
            chg: log file is opened with persistant handles on *nix

2.8004.450  new: Mac OS port including Altivec core support (twice as
                 fast as MMX on otherwise comparable hardware)

                 as service to allow the rest of the system to fire up first
            fix: all: not being able to -update if offlinemode
            fix: solaris: time stamps/elapsed time on MP boxes
            fix: all: clients will again reset work if the core # changes
                 (functionality was lost in 2.8002.446 - reset if client
                 version or platform changes was unaffected).

2.8003.448  new: x86: 50% faster CSC MMX core added. '6bit - bitslice'
                 replaces '6bit - called'
            fix: all: lines in mail/logfile are no longer truncated
            fix: all: pause by signal (by user) and pause by filename
                 are additive, that is, pause remains in effect as
                 long as either one is in effect.
            fix: all: completed/summary time is now elapsed wall clock
                 time again
            fix: x86: Cyrix 6x86 auto-selects CSC core #3 now.
            imp: all: threads no longer check external flags for shutdown/
                 pause state. Flags are 'pushed' instead, which reduces
                 cache footprint.
            fix: win32: win95B doesn't have a 'Lucinda Console' TrueType
                 font, so client avoids it now.
            chg: many: DES cores are no longer included
            imp: all: benchmarks have greater time precision (no longer
                 overshoot the end of the bench period)
            chg: *nix: client setsid()s and dups std handles to /dev/null
                 when started with -quiet/-hide
            fix: dun config collision with no-networking resolved
                 (dun was still active even if the networking was disabled)

2.8002.447  chg: all: firewall settings in the .ini have moved to the network
                 section. socks user:pass is now saved encoded
            chg: if appropriate, 'Summary:' now also shows # of work units
            chg: the cow logo is back, and is now the official mascot of
                 all distributed.net projects :)

2.8002.446  new: all: client is now called 'dnetc'
            new: all: OGR capability
            new: all: CSC capability

                 generic [parameters] section into subsections
            chg: all: each project has its own buffer settings (threshold etc)
            chg: all: cputype option has been phased out in favor of core
                 names/ids and each project can have its own core type
            chg: all: -benchmark and -benchmark2 can now be limited to a
                 single project, eg '-benchmark csc' to bench only csc
            new: all: '-bench [project]' benches all cores for a given
                 project (or all projects if no project is specified)

            new: win16/32: client saves window size and position
            chg: win32: service ID is 'dnetc' for client, 'dnetd' for pproxy
            new: netware: complete rewrite of netware specific code
            new: *nix: client distribution includes a man page
            chg: all: auto keyserver name resolution now allows as many
                 retries as there are addresses for a name.

            fix: x86: K7 auto selects 'class 6', not 'RISC rotate II' core.
            fix: x86 DOS: ^C always works now. (is now trapped in a hardware
                 interrupt (irq1) handler rather than in the 'soft' int 23h)
            imp: win16: scheduling and idle detection has been rewritten
            new: win16/win32: client archive includes a screen saver. When
                 run some _other_ screen saver in the foreground and start
                 start client in the background. It stops the client when
                 deactivated.
            new: win32: client will pause itself while it sees defrag running.
