The platforms/NetWare directory consists of...

 client.xdc The 'bagfile'. Created with mpkxdc -n
            (all threads are MT safe, and can run on any available CPU)

 obsolete.cpp This is the client for NetWare code July/1998

 ./inet/    stubs for functions in TCPIP.NLM and NETDB.NLM
            gethostname, inet_addr/network/aton/etc, 
            gethostby[name|addr]

 ./misc/    custom prelude and Watcom static clib avoidance stubs
            nwpre3x.c    The coolest replacement for prelude.c :)
            nwwatemu.c   Avoid gunk, er, I mean "Watcom CLIB3S.LIB"

 ./nwl*.*   library stubs/replacements   
            nwlemu.c     NetWare specific kernel/CLIB calls not
                         available on all NetWare versions
            nwmpk.c      stubs/emulation for MPK* API first introduced
                         with NetWare 5.x
            nwlcomp.c    misc ANSI/POSIX functions not available (or
                         poorly implemented). ftime(), usleep(), etc.
 
  ./nwc*.*  functions called from the client's common code
            nwccons.c    Console management stuff
            nwcconf.c    Read-in client-for-netware specific settings
            nwcmisc.c    Everything else (mostly short)
